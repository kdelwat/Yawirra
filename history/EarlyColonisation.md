# Context

From 1534 onwards, France, in response to Britain's colonial ambitions,
established a large colony in New France, on the North American continent,
covering modern-day Canada and parts of the United States.

The War of the Spanish Succession, beginning in 1701, saw France and Great
Britain at war over the territory nominally held by Spain, which was embroiled
in a succession crisis. In 1713, the sides signed the Treaty of Ulbrecht which
resigned the French expansion attempts to failure. Furthermore, France was
forced to concede part of New France: the provinces of Acadia and Newfoundland
came under control of Britain.

New France remained highly lucrative for the French, with abundant natural
resources that were accessible through the help of the indigenous population,
who were relied upon as guides and workers.

Between 1754 and 1756, Britain's aggression in the North American continent led
to the loss of French ships and sparked the Seven Years' War. Great Britain,
aligned with Prussia, Portugal, and German states, fought the coalition of
France, the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, Spain, and Sweden for dominance as a
colonial power. Battles in both Europe and North America proved disastrous for
France, and in 1763 the war came to a conclusion with the Treaty of Paris.

## Treaty of Paris

On the 10th of February, 1763, France, Great Britain and Spain signed the Treaty of
Paris, ending the Seven Years' War with Britain the victor. The terms of the
agreement led to a restoration of ownership for many defeated territories.
Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Tobago among others were returned to the
French, while Great Britain received Minorca and Sumatra.

However, France was forced to cede the entirety of New France to Great Britain,
ending her North American colonial ambitions and leading to a loss of
considerable natural resources. The loss of the prestigious colony outraged
King Louis XV of France, who saw it as a death blow to France's
territorial ambitions. Having heard from Dutch explorers of a potentially
fertile and wealthy continent in the south, he resolved to concentrate French
colonial efforts on Yawirra.

# Initial Exploration

In 1771, Louis XV dispatched two state missions to Yawirra. The first, led by
Yves de Kerguelen, was to explore the northern coast of the continent, while
the second, led by Louis Aleno de St. Aloüarn, continued along the southern
coast. Despite both ships leaving Mauritius together, stormy weather separated
the two. Kerguelen became lost and headed north, landing at Dirk Hartog
Island. After waiting two weeks for St. Aloüarn, Kerguelen decided to return
to France and set sail.

Meanwhile, St. Aloüarn had continued according to plan and landed at Aguillon
Bay on the 17th of March, 1772. When Kerguelen failed to arrive, he decided
to press on with his mission and continued around the southern coast.
