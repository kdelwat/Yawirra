# Yawirran Integrated Defence Force

While the Yawirran Military Organisation had seen considerable success
throughout its existence, the late 1980s had seen a growing discontent amongst
military commanders and politicans about its rigid traditional structure. This
had caused considerable difficulties during
the [Third Indochina War](/international/thirdindowar/), in which
disastrous defeats were attributed to the outdated system.

For many commanders, including General Olivier Platte, the Chief Commander of
the Army, the quintessential example of these failures was
the
[Battle of Krong Kampong Cham](/international/thirdindowar/battleofkkc/).
Seeking to seize control of an important crossing of the Mekong River for APEMA
forces, YMO forces pushed into the city of Krong Kampong Cham. Upon reaching
the river, they were counterattacked by insurgents from previously-cleared
areas, who had used supply tunnels to avoid detection. The counterattack split
the force in two and killed Colonel Serge Bonny, who was leading the attack. In
the resulting confusion, the chain-of-command broke down and led to a rout. At
one point, soldiers from one of bisected groups fired on the other in
confusion. The incident sparked a systematic review of the organisational
structure, culminating in the *Platte Report* which outlined recommendations
for a new system.

On the 1st of June, 1992, the YMO was replaced by a new structure named the
Yawirran Integrated Defence Force. The most radical of changes was the
abandonment of the traditional 'branch' structure in favour of mission-based
organisation. The five separate branches were combined into one, and the entire
heirarchy was replaced.

The key concept of the new system was 'streamed squads'. A squad was composed
of 10 personnel, who remained together for the majority of their military
careers. Each squad was trained in one of the ten military streams, and
underwent further training in substreams.

- **Infantry**: Infantry squads were trained as regular land-based soldiers,
  operating similar to the former Army branch. Substreams included different
  environments (forest, desert, mountains, urban) or skillsets (demolition,
  scout, combat medic).
- **Advance**: Advance squads were trained as the 'first on the ground'.
  Important training included amphibious landing and paratrooping, as well as
  advanced forward navigation and survival. Optional substreams trained unique
  skillsets, such as HALO jumping.
- **Special Forces**: Special forces squads were trained as elite soldiers,
  responsible for essential tasks such as hostage extraction and high-value
  target removal. Substreams included sniping and demolitions.
- **Air**: Air squads were trained in operation of military aircraft. A typical
  ten-person squad could operate five two-seater fighter jets or two transport
  planes. Substreams included training for different vehicles.
- **Sea**: Sea squads were trained in operation of military ships and naval
  equipment, in the same way as air and armoured squads.
- **Armoured**: Armoured squads were trained in operation of armoured land
  vehicles like tanks and APCs, in the same way as air and sea squads.
- **Engineer**: Engineer squads were trained in the maintenance of vehicles and
  equipment, with substreams training for individual vehicles, combat
  engineering, and artillery operation.
- **Signal**: Signal squads were trained in communications and radio operation.
  Substreams included forward radio operation and infrastructure deployment, as
  well as specialised cryptography units.
- **Logistics:** Logistics squads were trained through substreams in a variety
  of support roles, such as base maintenance, equipment transport, and supply
  management.
- **Technician:** Technician squads were trained in the maintenance of
  computational equipment and infrastructure.

Each squad was combined with nine others into a company, which could change
composition depending on mission requirements. Three companies made a division,
of which there were three types:

- **Forward:** Forward divisions were responsible for on-the-ground combat, and
  typically included infantry, air, sea, armoured, advance, and special forces
  squads.
- **Support:** Support divisions were responsible for on-base operation and
  support of forward divisions, and typically included engineer, signal,
  logistics, and technicican squads.
- **Reserve:** Reserve divisions were not attached to missions and were
  typically composed of squads of the same type, who remained in Yawirran bases
  for training.

Divisions were commanded in separate *missions*. A mission, which could be a
specific conflict or theatre, could take control of any combination of forward
and support divisions to fit the needed purposes. They could also control
individual division and company squad composition. While most missions
concerned conflict abroad, the permanent mission *Civil Defense* focussed on
protection of Yawirra's borders and emergency management.

In terms of command, there were three parallel command structures. *Strategic
command* was concerned with overall strategy and planning, as well as
logistical organisation of the entire YIDF. They liased with individual
*Mission Commands*, which commanded individual missions, and *Reserve Command*,
which organised reserve forces.
