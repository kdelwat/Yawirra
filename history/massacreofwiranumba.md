# Prelude

In the wake of a series of escalating protests by British miners against what
they called discrimination in mining license regulations, a group of miners in
Wiranumba, Monhoudou, decided to force the French authorities into action. The
leader of the group of 40 men, John Robertson, had gained prestige in the
protest movement for his scathing oratory attacks on the colonial authorities,
and together with two confidants he drafted the *Wiranumba Manifesto*, which
declared the following:

> We, the miners of the BRITISH EMPIRE, are tired of the endless discrimination
> of the FRENCH colonial authorities, who have made it their prerogative to
> ensure that no British man may MAKE A LIVING in the mining business. We ask
> them - are we not FELLOW MEN? Are we not working next to each other in the
> same brave new land, in the same dust and dirt, seeking the same riches?
>
> The tired excuses of the authorities will no longer appease us. Only real and
> concrete ACTION can do anything to halt the banner of anger under which we
> now rally. We demand the following, at the earliest opportunity, with the
> least delay, and with the concerted effort of the colonial authorities:
>
> + the ABOLITION of all mining license classes specifically tied to the
> British nationality of the licensee...
> + the IMMEDIATE RELEASE of all British citizens who have been incarcerated for
> rebelling against the oppressive French administration.
> + the FULL EQUALISATION of conditions and taxation between British and French
> miners on the Australian goldfields.
> + the GUARANTEE OF INDEMNITY for all those who join us in protesting against
> these unfair and unjust conditions.
>
> Return to us our liberty! Return to use our dignity!

# Seizure

On the morning of the 2nd of February, 1834, the miners published the Manifesto
in the *Miner's Herald*, the region's British newspaper, and posted it at the
offices of authorities in surrounding towns. Shortly before 9AM, the group
burst into the Wiranumba Provincial Administration Office, weapons drawn, and
ordered all staff to leave the building, with the exception of the Provincial
Adminstrator Jacques Edmonteau and his assistant, Land Manager Gupirra Nalu.
The staff complied unanimously, while the two hostages were locked in
Edmonteau's office and provided with food and water. On the flagpole outside,
the Miner's Jack, a flag symbolising the protest movement, was raised,
replacing the French flag.

# Seige

As the day wore on, French colonial [gendarmes](/yawirra/society/gendarmerie/)
arrived at the scene and established a line of communication with the occupiers.
The Gendarmerie refused to acknowledge the demands of the miners while there
remained hostages, while the British were afraid to give up their only leverage.
Frustrated at the lack of response from the French, the miners set alight an
exterior records store at 8pm, in an attempt to show the severity of their
rebellion. However, the French forces remained calm and allowed the fire to burn
through the night, hoping that sleep deprivation would soon set in amongst the
miners.

With dawn came a party of 5 miners who wished to make a deal with the French,
asking for immunity from prosecution in exchange for leaving the complex and
providing information to the besiegers, who gladly agreed to the terms. Having
established the positions and equipment of the miners, the Gendarmerie realised
that a head-on attack would be foolish, in particular due to the high number of
miners inside the fortified building. Instead, they again adopted a strategy of
attrition.

At midday, two miners, identified as Alfie Barnaby and Piers Coleman, shot at
the perimeter guards from a window on the left side of the building. Returning
fire, the gendarmes injured Barnaby and killed Coleman. The move prompted anger
inside the building, and another flag was hoisted beneath the Miner's Jack: a
plain, blood red pennant. A message from the occupiers was received: under no
circumstances would they cooperate unless all their demands were met within the
next hour.

At 2pm, having heard no response from the French, 7 miners fled the complex and
begged for immunity, realising that the colonial forces would not acquiesce.
They were followed at 3:15pm by another group of 4, leaving only 24 British
inside.

# Storming

Recognising their opportunity, the Gendarmerie quickly decided to launch a full
attack on the building. Armed with high-powered muskets and Molotov cocktails,
the mission of the gendarmes was simple: remove the British threat as soon as
possible, with no regard for the colonial property.

At 2:45pm, the French began their attack. A large force of gendarmes approached
the building with wooden boards for cover, under musket fire from the windows.
While initially pinned down by the counter-fire, grenades soon set the main
building ablaze and distracted opposition, allowing the Gendarmerie to enter.
Once inside, the fighting moved to bloody martial combat, but the French
bayonets proved a highly superior weapon. Within 15 minutes of the first
breach, the authorities had secured the compound.

# Aftermath

The assault resulted in the death of all 24 British miners still inside the
building, 10 French gendarmes, and hostage Gupirra Nalu, who was killed by a
bullet through the door of Edmonteau's office. Edmonteau himself escaped
unscathed but shaken by the death of his assistant.

The immediate reaction from the British mining population of Monhoudou and of
the British colony of New South Wales was unfettered outrage, particularly
following the news that the 16 miners who had been guaranteed immunity in
exchange for their cooperation had in fact been imprisoned following the
assault. The Governor of New South Wales, Sir Richard Bourke, released a brief
statement before meeting with his Legislative Council to decide on a course of
action, which read:

> The bloody violence we have witnessed in Wiranumba today is an attack on all
> British; on Britain and her Sovereignty, and on His Majesty King William. I
> will not react lightly to the slaughter of British citizens at the hands of the
> brutual French Gendarmerie. I will not allow such an event to pass unnoticed.
> We stand with the British in Monhoudou and in other territories of the
> so-called *civilised* French, who have today proven they are anything but. May
> God have mercy on their souls.

The aftermath of the event saw the boiling over of tensions between the two
colonial powers, and ultimately led to the defeat and exit from Yawirra of
the British in the [Yawirran Colonial War](/yawirra/history/colonialwar/).
