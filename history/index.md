The history of Yawirra can be broadly split into three stages: pre-settlement,
colonial, and independent. The first is dealt with
in [pre-settlement](/yawirra/presettlement/), while the remainder is detailed here.

# The Yawirran Colonial War

In August 1832, all French colonies instituted mandatory gold licenses for
miners. France, concerned about British influence in their colonies, created a
seperate license class for British miners which was more expensive, and carried
restricted rights and higher taxation. A series of protests by British miners
from 1832 to 1834 against the harsh license requirements was accompanied by
acts of sabotage against French government property, sparking accusations by
France that the British government was deliberately inflaming the tensions.

The protests came to a head on the 4th of February, 1934, when a group of 40
British miners seized the goldfields administration offices in Wiranumba.
Monhoudou authorities reacted brutally, killing 24 of the miners and
imprisoning the 16 others, suffering 10 deaths in the process.
