The government of the Republic of Yawirra is split between three branches: the
executive, comprising the President, Prime Minister, and Cabinet; the
legislative, comprising the Parliament; and the judicial, comprising the courts.

# Executive

The head of the executive branch and of state is the non-partisan President,
elected by a supermajority of 70% of the combined Parliament. The President has
a primarily ceremonial role: while they must sign all legislation before it
recieves assent into law, there has only been one case in history of the
President exercising their right to reject legislation, during the
[2005 Constitutional Crisis](/2005ConstitutionalCrisis.html). The President is
accountable to the legislative branch and can be impeached through a vote of no
confidence, requiring a supermajority to pass.

True power in the executive branch is held by the Prime Minister, who is the
head of government, and the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is chosen by the party
or parties holding a majority in the combined Parliament. They then select
Counsels who take positions in the Cabinet. The Counsel roles are currently as
follows, in order of importance:

+ **Counsel of the Interior**, responsible for internal affairs including
  security, immigration, and justice.
+ **Counsel of the Exterior**, responsible for foreign affairs.
+ **Counsel of the Economy**, responsible for economic management and taxation.


The executive branch takes most responsibility for setting the legislative
agenda, due to their superior numbers in the Parliament. The branch does not
need legislative approval for acts of foreign policy with the exception of
declaration of war.

# Legislative

*See also:* [Political parties](/politics/parties.html)

The legislative branch is comprised of a bicameral parliament, with a lower
house called the Legislative Assembly and an upper house called the National
Council. Legislation must on most occasions pass both houses to become law. On
some occasions, including the nomination of the President and Prime Minister,
constitutional amendment, and the annual supply budget, both houses sit together
in combined Parliament.

The **Legislative Assembly** is made up of 332 seats, elected from single-member
constituencies. Members are elected through a two-round runoff system, in which
two rounds of elections are held. In the first, each voter selects their
preferred candidate from all those running. In the second, all candidates but
those two who recieved the most votes are eliminated, and the voter again
chooses their preference. This has the advantage of increasing the chance of the
election of smaller parties, as voters are likely to select their absolute
preference in the first round and their compromise preference in the second.
However, it has the disadvantage of not allowing preferential voting,
potentially impacting moderate parties.

The **National Council** is made up of 100 seats. The seats are divided between
three sources: the states, who each recieve 10 seats, the three territories, who
each elect one, and the Elders' Councils of the seven largest Indigenous
nations. Each state elects their councillors through a closed-list proportional
vote, with seats allocated through the Sainte-LaguÃ« method. In the territories,
the seat is elected through an instant-runoff ballot. Each Elders' Council has
their own method for delegating their representative. In some, all members of
the nation are given a vote, whereas in others only members of the Council may
decide.
