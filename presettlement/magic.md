*As told by Parru Gupii.*

Yawirra is a land deeply entwined with magic, which is concentrated into
geographical hotspots and can be harnessed by a highly-trained subset of the
inhabitants: the Panyarni.

# Magical Ability

In Ngujari inheritance, the population is split into four "totems": the seal,
the black wallaby, the platypus, and the satin bowerbird. People of each can
more easily utilise the magic of a single *Nnurru*, and may have access to
exclusive techniques. The pattern of totem inheritance is rigid but simple, with
a woman of a specific totem obliged to partner with a man of another prescribed
totem to produce offspring of an entirely different totem. However, the
inheritance is ultimately cyclic.

| Man       | Woman     | Offspring |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Seal      | Wallaby   | Platypus  |
| Wallaby   | Seal      | Bowerbird |
| Bowerbird | Platypus  | Wallaby   |
| Platypus  | Bowerbird | Seal      |

While magical ability is inherent in all Ngujari people, most do not have the
required strength to use it. The small subset of the population who are deemed
able are trained to join the Panyarni, an elite band of hunters who use their
magic to investigate and defend the Ngujari against the presence of the
Winmiiju.

# Origins

In Ngujari stories, magic is said to come from the four brothers who discovered
the land they now occupy: Bilru, the Seal; Gunya, the Wallaby; Juunwi, the
Bowerbird; and Pilkiya, the Platypus. The four brothers made their homes in the
environments most suited for their physiology. Bilru constructed his on a rock
formation near the coast, allowing him to spend his days swimming in the ocean.
Gunya settled in the low-lying area next to the beach, where he could find
plenty of food to eat. Juunwi made his home high in the mountains, where he
could soar above the treetops and find beautiful objects to decorate his home.
Pilkiya chose a river that cut through the mountain, so he could enjoy the water
and travel around the whole of the area.

While the four brothers were content with their new home, Winmii, a snake, was
envious of their lands, and decided that he would try to force them out and keep
it for himself and his family. In the middle of the night, while the brothers
were sleeping, he crept up to where they lay and poisoned them. In the morning,
they awoke in great pain and close to death. Realising what Winmii had done,
they decided that they must protect their land even in death, and allowed
themselves to be overcome while conscious, releasing their spirits to defend
their resting place for eternity.

The magic of the land is now said to be these spirits, who allow themselves to
be used by the Ngujari in the fight against Winmii's ancestors,
the [Winmiiju](/yawirra/presettlement/winmiiju).

# Nnurrus

The four Nnurrus are isolated amongst the land of the Ngujari. A brief
description of each is below.

## Bilrunnalu

A great platform of grey rock juts out from the water and is home to a colony of
seals. Bilrunnalu is the most inaccessible of the Nnurrus, with a trip by bark
canoe required to reach the island. Waves are constantly crashing into the
bordering rocks, covering the island in a mist of sea spray and diffusing the
sun's light so that any Panyarni who stands on the island sees only the inside
of a globe of yellow and orange.

## Gunyannalu

This area is a small clearing in the middle of low-lying forest, surrounded by
towering mountains. A small stream cuts through the clearing and brings with it
fish and platypi. At night, glowworms illuminate the area in a constellation of
tiny lights, giving the impression that a Panyarni is standing in the centre of
a globe of stars.

## Juunwinnalu

Sitting at the peak of the highest mountain in the land, the area is damp and
green, and looks out over the lush sclerophyll forests and deep blue ocean.
During the late afternoons, cloud frequently rolls in and covers the
mountaintop, allowing the Panyarni to literally sit inside the clouds.

## Pilkiyannalu

A large waterfall tumbles into a deep lagoon, enclosed on all sides by dense
scrub and tree trunks. Smooth rocks provide stepping stones across the lagoon
and a place to sit in front of the waterfall, back facing the continuing clear
and cool river. Underneath the waterfall is a small cave providing a shelter
with three walls of rock and one of rushing water.
