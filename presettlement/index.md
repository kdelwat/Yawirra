*Note: This section is unique in that many of the articles are written in the
present tense, in an attempt to capture the reality of the time. The author is
a member of the Ngujari tribe.*

*In addition, very little is known about the other tribes of Yawirra at the time
of settlement. Accordingly, the section focuses on the Ngujari tribe, whose
lifestyle and beliefs were well-documented and endure today.*

# Context

Before the arrival of the French and British colonialists, Yawirra was home to
a rich indigenous culture. At the time of the first French colony at
Concarneau, there were an estimated 750,000 indigenous inhabitants in the
country, divided into a number of different language groups.

Having recognised the importance of co-operation with indigenous peoples during
their experiences in New France, the colonisers immediately set out to build a
relationship with the Ngujari tribe who lived around the settlement. The
relationship proved extremely profitable for both parties, and today Ngujari is
the dominant ethnic group of the country, having occupied new areas of the
nation alongside France.

However, those indigenous tribes who found themselves under British control did
not fare as well. The assimilationist approach of the settlers lead to a series
of conflicts and massacres, which coupled with the invasion of European
diseases led to the decimation of the population.
