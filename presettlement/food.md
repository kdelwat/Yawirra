*As told by Parru Gupii.*

Food and drink plays a central role in the lifestyle of the Ngujari people.
Food is obtained locally through a combination of hunting, gathering, and
small-scale forest gardening which provides food year-round.

# Dishes

These dishes are examples of dietary staples, although the nature of hunting
and gathering means the availability of such meals is sometimes limited.

## Walyuu

A mixture of cooked river shellfish, including yabbies, cut in chunks of around
3cm^2 and stir-fried with vegetables.

## Ringannaru

Kangaroo steak, cooked rare and diced, is added to a mixture of fried desert
yam and other native tubers.

## Pijii Rulla

Starch from the wild arrowroot plant, usually bitter until processing, is made
into small cakes which are baked in a fire oven.
