The Asia-Pacific Economic and Military Alliance was founded on the 5th of June,
1962, in Auckland, New Zealand. The Alliance's original eight members have now
swelled to eighteen, including some of the most advanced economies in the
world, lending it considerable strength and influence.

# Function

The Alliance is founded on three principles which are enshrined in the first
article of the Auckland Convention, and three resolutions, which are known as
Articles 2-4:

> Article 1: The Alliance is committed to three core principles: total
> co-operation, equal representation, and mutual defense.
>
> Article 2: The Alliance will establish a standing trade agreement between all
> members, with no special restrictions on individual members. Members resolve
> to maintain no seperate trade agreements with other states who are currently
> members of the Alliance.
>
> Article 3: The Alliance will ensure decisions are made democratically, with
> each member allowed one vote and the choice of acception, abstention, or
> rejection. A majority is required to pass a standard resolution. Declaration
> of war requires a supermajority of at least two thirds of members. Any
> Resolution recieving majority abstentions is automatically rejected.
>
> Article 4: The Alliance will commit to the defense of all of its members. Any
> member who is threatened military may invoke this article. The Alliance is
> obligated to provide all military support possible in defense of the member,
> without exception.

# Members

## 1962: Founding States

Upon its foundation in 1962, eight members signed the Auckland Convention and
became full members of APEMA. The creation was spearheaded by the "big three" of
Yawirra, New Zealand, and Malaysia, with New Caledonia, the Philippines, Brunei,
Laos, and South Korea opting to take part from the beginning. While other
nations expressed interest in eventually joining the Alliance, concern around
mutual defense obligations led them to delay joining until they had evidence of
the Alliance's progress.

## 1965: Singapore

Following race riots in 1964, Malaysia expelled Singapore from their short-lived
union. With blood running hot between the two nations, Malaysia objected to
attempts by Singapore to join the Alliance in its own right. However, the
admission vote passed with one abstention (the Philippines) and two opposing
(Malaysia and Brunei).

## 1968: Indonesia

After coming to power in a military coup, General Suharto and his New Order government accelerated his predecessors' plans to join APEMA, with the twin hopes of boosting economic development and appeasing leftist protestors.

## 1974: New Hebrides

Long ruled by dual French and British administrations, the small island nation
of New Hebrides had seen a growing nationalist movement, led by the New Hebrides
National Party (NHP), evolve into a full-scale war for independence. Covert
support for the nationalist forces was provided by several APEMA members,
including Yawirra and New Zealand, and the colonial forces soon withdrew. In the
first democratic election that followed, the NHP was elected and opted to join
the Alliance.

## 1974: Thailand

A period of unrest had culminated in the 1973 Student Uprising, which led to an
unstable government which alternated between followers of Seni and Kukrit
Pramoj. Already facing popular discontent, a sharp global increase in oil prices
plunged the country into recession. The government swiftly decided to join the
Alliance in an attempt to stimulate the economy and avoid a recurrance of the
damaging recession.

## 1982: Papua

After growing calls for self-determination, Papua, a territory of Yawirra, voted
to become an independent republic and joined APEMA upon its foundation.

## 1985: Kampuchea

*Main article*: [Third Indochina War](/international/thirdindowar/)

The protracted Third Indochina War (began 1979) between Vietnam and APEMA
coalition forces came to an end in 1984 with the Vietnamese army pushed out of
Kampuchea. The APEMA-supported Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea was
returned from exile and set an election date of one year from the day of
armistice. The newly-elected government had campaigned on APEMA membership and
immediately joined the Alliance.

## 1986: Bougainville

The territory of Bougainville was under control of Yawirra as a United Nations
protectorate since the end of World War 2. In 1985, it was granted the right to
self-determination and the choice of independence or becoming an official
territory of Yawirra. A contentious campaign led to a divided vote that was
narrowly in favour of independence. The new government, as a concession to the
losing side which continued to hold daily protests, announced that it would join
APEMA.

## 1988: Fiji

Following 1987's second successful military coup, the new leadership chooses to
join APEMA in the hope that it would cement their national rule.

## 1990: Myanmar

After the 8888 Uprising of 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council
took power through force and decided to join APEMA. Widespread nationalist
protests were brutally suppressed, leading APEMA to unanimously reject the
membership application in 1989, the first rejection in the Alliance's history.
However, a national election gave victory to the National League of Democracy,
who despite being barred from power by the military supported admission to the
Alliance and quelled street unrest. The second application was successful by a
narrow margin, with 9 for, 5 against (Yawirra, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Fiji,
Bougainville), and 2 abstentions (Papua, New Hebrides).

## 2006: West Papua

In 2006, West Papua voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia in a
UN-adminstered referendum and opted to join APEMA immediately afterwards.
