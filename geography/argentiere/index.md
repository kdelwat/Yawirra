Argentière is a semi-autonomous city-state under control of Yawirra, located in
the Indian Ocean to the west of Angourie. As of the 2015 census, it was the
second-largest city in Yawirra (after Sydney) with 5,440,288 inhabitants. As
part of its special autonomous status, the city is governed by
the [Argentière City Parliament](/geography/argentiere/politics/) which holds
power equivalent to that of a state.

# Geography

The island of Argentière is notable for the towering Mont Roignais, which
divides the city into two. The larger part of the city sits on the south side
of the island, comprising the central business district of Eaubonne, the city's
passenger and freight harbor, and the majority of the high-density residential
and commercial areas. On the north side is the international airport,
industrial zones, and sprawling suburbs. Joining the two regions is *le Grand
Col*, a highway which cuts through the saddle separating Mont Roignais in the
west and Pic d'Assy in the east, as well as a railway tunnel.

# History

The island of Argentière was discovered on the 5th of January, 1772, by Louis
Aleno de St. Aloürn during his maiden expedition to the continent of Yawirra.
Claiming the land for France, he named it Argentière in reference to a village
of the same name in the French Alps. St. Aloürn later stated that the towering
Mont Roignais was the inspiration for the name.

During the [early colonisation](/history/earlycolonisation/) of
Yawirra, French explorers and settlers used the island as a staging point for
expeditions to the mainland. Its position made it ideal for ships to resupply
before the return journey to France.

The island was incorporated into the colony of Angourie during its founding in
1807 and remained a part of the state until 1952, when it was awarded
territorial status alongside Papua.

The forty years that followed saw the rise of separatism among the island's
populations, spearheaded by the Popular League for an Autonomous Argentière
(known colloquially as *la Ligue Populaire* or the *LP*). However, this
sentiment was not shared by the entirety of the population, and rival loyalist
groups grew in power. The period between 1980 and 1995 was particularly divided
both politically and culturally.

On the 18th of August, 1995, revolutionary independence groups launched a
coordinated attempt to secede from Yawirra. Despite opposition from
militant loyalists, a large majority of the population supported the movement.
The following three weeks saw open conflict in the urban areas between soldiers
and citizens of Argentière and Yawirra.
