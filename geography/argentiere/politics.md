Since its establishment in 1809, the Argentière City Parliament has been the
official governing body of Argentière, responsible for state-level functions
including education and healthcare. As a semi-autonomous state, the Parliament
is afforded special powers in the realms of foreign policy and defence.

# Structure

The City Parliament is unicameral, with one house of 151 seats allocated by
party-list proportional representation. Elections occur every three years using
the Sainte-Laguë method with a representation threshold of 3%.
