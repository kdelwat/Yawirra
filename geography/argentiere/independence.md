The history of Argentière has been marked by decades of struggle over
independence.

# Context

In 1807, Argentière was officially incorporated into the state of Angourie upon
its foundation, a move that was widely supported by the island's mostly
transient population. However, the years that followed saw a growing native
population which demanded greater power and autonomy for the
economically-developing island. The primary complaint of this early movement
was the distribution of taxation income by the Angourie government. Comprising
42% of the state's economic income, Argentière received just 25% of revenue
according to a formula which favoured mainland development.

# Territorial Status

By the 1950s, a variety of parties in
the [Argentière City Parliament](/geography/argentiere/politics) had
begun openly calling for secession from Angourie. In March 1952, mass street
demonstrations saw upwards of 200,000 citizens protesting the lack of
government funding and self-management of internal affairs. For three days, the
Chief Minister of Angourie, Pierre Lazard, refused to meet with organisers,
derogatorily referring to the 'temporary rabble' as a minor inconvenience. On
the 8th of May, 5 ministers from the National Party presented a no-confidence
motion against Lazard, citing his handling of the incident. In the resulting
vote, Lazard was supported by a large majority and the offending ministers were
dismissed.

The lack of action by the state government further incensed demonstrators, and
small-scale rioting took place against government buildings. The escalating
violence brought national attention to the issue, and on the 11th of May the
leader of the national government, Purrii Ardoin of the Worker's Alliance
Party, ordered Lazard to modify the taxation formula. However, the Compact of
Yawirran Statehood expressly gave responsibility for taxation to individual
states, and the order was declared illegal by the government of Angourie.

With no further ability to intervene in the state's affairs, Ardoin took the
unprecedented step of requesting the annexation of Argentière by the French
government. The Prime Minister of France, Antoine Pinay, represented the
National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNI), a party with a strong
history of supporting business interests. On the 15th of May, Pinay decided to
grant the request for annexation on the grounds of unfair tax burden on the
economy of Argentière. This decision formally designated Argentière as a
territory of Yawirra, allowing it to collect local taxes for administration
functions and handing control of infrastructure to the Yawirran government,
which used a fairer redistribution formula.

The change in status placated the majority of protesters, and the secession
movement began to wane.
