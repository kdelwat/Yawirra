Yawirra is a nation greatly involved in sports. The two primary team sports are
football (soccer) and marngrook, of Indigenous origin.

# Football

Football is the most popular sport of Yawirra, with 1.4 million registered players
and three professional leagues, which run as follows, in order of rank:

+ *Ligue Primaire*, or *LP*, contested by 18 teams.
+ *Ligue Secondaire*, or *LS*, contested by 16 teams.
+ *Ligue Mineure*, or *LMin*, contested by 16 teams.

The tournament structure for the LP is a round-robin, in which each team plays
each other twice, for position on a ladder. The top 8 teams then play in a
series of single-elimination finals, culminating in the Championship. A similar
structure takes place in the LS and LMin, except that only the top 4 teams
advance to the finals.

The regular season takes place from March to August, but in September and
October there is another single-elimination tournament, the *Coupe de Yawirra*,
which includes all teams from the LP and LS. The two final teams meet to decide
the *Coupe des Champions*.

All three professional leagues operate on a system of relegation and promotion.
The top four teams from the LS and LMin are exchanged with the bottom four of
the higher league, to ensure that the teams with the highest standard of play
are in the LP.

The 2015 winners were as follows:

+ *Ligue Primaire*: **Sydney-Est**
+ *Ligue Secondaire*: **Acremont**
+ *Ligue Mineure*: **Parunya-Jirru**
+ *Coupe des Champions*: **Villeneuve**

# Marngrook

Marngrook is the country's second most popular sport, with 1.1 million
registered players, and has its origin in the games of the pre-settlement
Indigenous peoples.

There are two professional leagues: Division 1 and Division 2, each with 16
teams. Both operate in a double round-robin system with the top 8 teams playing
a single-elimination final series. The winner of the Division 1 championship
recieves the *Rapartya Cup*. In 2015, the Cup was won by **Kiinbuk**, with
Division 2 won by **Saint Frion**.

The regular season runs from February to July. There is no relegation and
promotion mechanism between the two divisions.

## Rules

Similar to Gaelic Football, the sport sees two teams of 16 players attempt to
score points by kicking or passing a ball through a set of goalposts, which take
the "H" formation of rugby. Passing the ball through the lower half of the
goalposts scores one point, while kicking it over the cross-bar scores four.

A player may run with the ball, but the other team is allowed to tackle them. If
the player does not avoid the tackle and holds on to the ball, it is turned over
to the other team. The ball may be passed using the feet or the hands, however
using the hands requires players to hold the ball in one hand and punch it with
the other. The game is notable for its high jumps to catch the ball, but
catching the ball does not cause a stoppage.

The game is played over two halves of 45 minutes each.
